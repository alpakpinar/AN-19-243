\section{Introduction} \label{section:introduction}

This analysis note describes a search for events in which the Higgs boson is produced by vector boson fusion (VBF), 
decaying into invisible particles in the final state. The signature of such a final state will be two seperated jets 
and an imbalance in $\vpt$ due to the undetected particles. Two seperated jets are the result of the 
hadronization of two final state quarks emerging from the VBF process.

This analysis makes use of data collected with the CMS detector in proton-proton (pp) collisions in 2017 
and 2018 at $\sqrt{s}=13\TeV$, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.3 $\fbinv$ and 59.7 $\fbinv$, 
respectively. 

The analysis strategy is similar to that of 2016 VBF analysis, with several improvements. One of the major 
improvements in this analysis is the addition of the photon control region as the fifth control region. 
The addition of this new control region provides additional constraint and sensitivity on the final fit.
In addition to this, the theory scale factors are re-derived in this analysis for VBF topology.
