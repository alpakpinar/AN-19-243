\section{Comparison of 1D and 2D QCD k-factors}
\label{sec:1d_vs_2d_kfac}

In this appendix, several distributions such as recoil, $\mjj$ and $\detajj$ are compared for two cases in the single muon
control region:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plots with 1D k-factors applied: Function of gen-boson pt
    \item Plots with 2D k-factors applied: Function of gen-boson pt and $\mjj$
\end{itemize}

Both k-factors are derived from samples in which the VBF selections are applied at the gen level. 1D k-factor is a function of
generator level vector boson $\pt$, whereas 2D k-factor is a function of both generator level boson $\pt$ and $\mjj$. 
The distributions are shown in the following pages. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:recoil_2017} shows the comparison of the recoil distribution 
with 2017 samples, while Fig.~\ref{fig:recoil_2018} shows the same comparison with 2018 samples. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:mjj_2017} shows the comparison of the $\mjj$ distribution 
with 2017 samples, while Fig.~\ref{fig:mjj_2018} shows the same comparison with 2018 samples. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:detajj_2017} shows the comparison of the $\detajj$ distribution 
with 2017 samples, while Fig.~\ref{fig:detajj_2018} shows the same comparison with 2018 samples. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:muon_pt_2017} shows the comparison of the muon $\pt$ distribution 
with 2017 samples, while Fig.~\ref{fig:muon_pt_2018} shows the same comparison with 2018 samples. 
Fig.~\ref{fig:muon_eta_2017} shows the comparison of the muon $\eta$ distribution 
with 2017 samples, while Fig.~\ref{fig:muon_eta_2018} shows the same comparison with 2018 samples.
