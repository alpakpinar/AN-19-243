\section{Trigger} 
\label{sec:trigger}

The data used in this analysis is collected using triggers that are designed to collect events with high $\ptmiss$ and $\htmiss$. 
These triggers rely on the online version of the Particle Flow algorithm. While calculating $\ptmiss$ and $\htmiss$, identified
Particle Flow muons are removed from the event. Therefore, using the same triggers, one can also select dimuon (Z \rightarrow \mu \mu) 
and single muon (W \rightarrow \mu \nu) events.

The remaining control regions include dielectron (Z \rightarrow ee) and single electron (W \rightarrow e\nu) regions. In these two control
regions, events are selected using the Single Electron trigger. The full list of triggers used in this analysis are given in 
Tab.~\ref{tab:triggers}.
