\newlabel{fig:wmnCR}{{53}{69}{Comparison between data and MC simulation in the single-muon (upper row) and single-electron (lower row) control samples before and after performing the simultaneous fit across all the control samples and the signal region assuming the absence of any signal. Plots correspond to the monojet (left) and mono-$\PV $ (right) categories, respectively, in the single-lepton control samples. The hadronic recoil \pt in single-lepton events is used as a proxy for \ptmiss in the signal region. The other backgrounds include top quark, diboson, and QCD multijet processes.
